## Lab Experiments

1. Design and implement C/C++ Program to find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected
undirected graph using Kruskal's algorithm.

2. Design and implement C/C++ Program to find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected
undirected graph using Prim's algorithm.

3. a. Design and implement C/C++ Program to solve All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem using Floyd's
algorithm.
b. Design and implement C/C++ Program to find the transitive closure using Warshal's
algorithm.

4. Design and implement C/C++ Program to find shortest paths from a given vertex in a weighted
connected graph to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.

5. Design and implement C/C++ Program to obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a given
digraph.

6. Design and implement C/C++ Program to solve 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic
Programming method.

7. Design and implement C/C++ Program to solve discrete Knapsack and continuous Knapsack
problems using greedy approximation method.

8. Design and implement C/C++ Program to find a subset of a given set S = {sl , s2,.....,sn} of n
positive integers whose sum is equal to a given positive integer d.

9. Design and implement C/C++ Program to sort a given set of n integer elements using Selection
Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and
record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read
from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.

10. Design and implement C/C++ Program to sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort
method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and
record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read
from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.

11. Design and implement C/C++ Program to sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort
method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and
record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read
from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.

12. Design and implement C/C++ Program for N Queen's problem using Backtracking.
